Create a single html page containing the story, the CSS and any required JS to do a read-along that highlights each word as it is spoken.
Be smart about it. Use sequence numbers on the word tags to index into the json array to pull out the alignment data instead of storing it as data-attributes on the element.

Format everything so that we get a nice reading experience.

The mp3 file will be placed beside the html file.

The html will be served by the python http module.
