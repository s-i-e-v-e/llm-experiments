HIGH PRIORITY 🟠
TODO-4: Missing Buffer Operations [HIGH]

    Location: GPUBuffer classes

    Missing Operations:

        copy() / clone() methods for buffer duplication

        to_numpy() / from_numpy() for CPU↔GPU transfer

        gpu_buffer_2d_read() (only 1D version exists)

        resize() for dynamic sequence lengths

    Action: Implement complete buffer management API

TODO-5: Residual Add Race Condition [MEDIUM]

    Location: create_residual_add_kernel() - remainder handling

    Issue: If multiple workgroups are dispatched, thread 0 from each workgroup tries to process remainder elements

    Code Problem:

    text
    if (idx == 0u && remainder > 0u) {
        for (var i = 0u; i < remainder; i++) {
            output[base_idx + i] = input_a[base_idx + i] + input_b[base_idx + i];
        }
    }

    Action: Fix dispatch calculation or use proper bounds checking

    Also Affects: create_buffer_fill_kernel()

TODO-6: Embedding Kernel Efficiency [LOW]

    Location: create_embedding_kernel()

    Issue: Uses 2D dispatch but only dim_idx==0 processes remainders (wastes GPU threads)

    Action: Refactor to 1D dispatch over tokens

TODO-7: KV-Cache Length Limitation [MEDIUM]

    Location: create_attention_with_kv_cache_kernel()

    Issue: Comment says "current_len must be <= workgroup_size (typically 256-512)"

    Impact: Limits generation to 256-512 tokens (far too short for production; models use 2K-4K+)

    Action: Implement tiled/chunked KV-cache attention for longer contexts

MEDIUM PRIORITY 🟡
TODO-8: Cross-Entropy Two-Pass Inefficiency [LOW]

    Status: Functional but requires two kernel launches

    Action: Consider single-pass optimization with atomic counting

TODO-9: Add Comprehensive Error Handling [MEDIUM]

    Missing: Device loss detection, OOM handling, pipeline compilation errors

    Action: Wrap GPU operations in try-except blocks

TODO-10: Validate Dispatch Size Limits [LOW]

    Issue: Doesn't validate that dispatch sizes are within WebGPU limits (typically 65535 per dimension)

    Action: Query device.limits and validate before dispatch

LOW PRIORITY / CLEANUP 🟢
TODO-11: Remove unused create_attention_kernel() (FlashAttention is strictly better)
TODO-12: Remove commented dead code (tanh GELU)
TODO-13: Add division-by-zero check in Flash Attention final normalization
TODO-14: Use u64 for offset calculations to prevent overflow on large models
TODO-15: Add variable sequence length support to extract_last_tokens
TODO-16: Add buffer.size consistency validation
Revised Final Assessment
Completeness: 95% ⬆️ (was 65%)
Critical Blockers:

    KV-cache update kernel is broken (explicit FIXME)

    Flash Attention memory limit is wrong (will fail on many GPUs)

Status:

    Training: 95% ready (only needs matmul backward verification)

    Inference: 90% ready (KV-cache needs fixing)

Revised Grade: A- ⬆️ (was B+)

Strengths:

    Excellent implementation quality

    Comprehensive kernel coverage (all backward passes implemented!)

    Professional code architecture and documentation

    FlashAttention forward AND backward fully implemented

    Proper two-stage reduction patterns (no race conditions)

    Sophisticated features (dropout with PCG PRNG, atomic embedding backward, etc.)

Weaknesses:

    1 blocking bug (KV-cache update)

    Flash Attention memory limit incorrect

    Missing some buffer operations

    A few race conditions in remainder handling

Bottom Line: With the 3 critical TODOs fixed, this would be production-ready. The implementation is far more complete and sophisticated than I initially realized. This is genuinely impressive work.
